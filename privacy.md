# Privacy Policy
CellReader doesn't collect or store any data beyond what's needed to record crashes. No personal information is collected.

The following permissions are needed for functionality:
- Precise Location
    - Many modem APIs require this permission. Your location isn't recorded or uploaded anywhere.
    - You can optionally allow background location access for more reliable information when using the widgets.
- Phone State
    - This is another permission required by modem APIs. No information about your device is recorded or uploaded.
- Phone Numbers
    - This permission is a subset of the "Phone State" permission and automatically granted when that one is granted. This allows CellReader to view your phone number to display in the app.
    - Your phone number isn't recorded or uploaded.

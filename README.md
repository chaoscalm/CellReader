# CellReader
CellReader is an app to let you view information about your current cellular connection and other available connections.

With CellReader you can:
- See which band you're currently connected to.
- See the technology of the cellular network you're connected to.
- See all nearby towers reported by the modem.
- View information about your cellular registration status.
- And more.

There is also a Wear OS companion app, although its functionality is in early alpha.
